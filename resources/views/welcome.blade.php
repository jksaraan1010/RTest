        <br>        <br>

        I am very into country music. My favorite artist is Luke Bryan. I enjoy cooking,
        Indian and pasta's. I have a few things on my bucket list like spending new years at
        Time Square, going to Super Bowl once in my lifetime, and a Luke Bryan concert. My
        favorite food (snack) is popcorn, I can have that all day every day all variety's. I
        have one younger sister. I will be the first child to start earning in my family.
        I am from India, and went there in 2010, since 2000 when we moved to the USA. Did all
        my schooling here.
        <br>        <br>

        I love watching movies in my free time. I love bollywood, and hollywood. I like action,
        mystery, and romantic comedy's. My favorite actor's include Leonardo DiCaprio, Camron Diaz,
        Sandra Bullock, but if I had to choose one male it would be Adam Sandler, and one female it
        would be Jennifer Aniston. They came in a movie together, one of my all time favorite
        movie Just Go With It. I have also watch many TV shows. Some of my favorites are:
        Gilmore Girls, Grey's Anatomy, This Is Us, Ugly Betty and How I Met Your Mother.
        <br>        <br>

        I also follow sports. I like to watch football, but the Lions are not playing well,
        like when have they ever. I like the Seatle Seahawks, Russel Wilson and Richard Sherman.
        I volunteer with Seva4Everybody, its a non profit org made by Sikh's and they have events
        throuhout the city of Detroit. My favorite is the Thanksgiving one, we give out meals
        to the homeless outside. By far my favorite, you learn so much when you help others and
        see others dont have life as good as you, it makes you re-think everything.
